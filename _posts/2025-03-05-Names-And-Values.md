Hi there, in this article you will read about some interested findings about how Python deals with names and values, convertionally called as variables, and why it is totally different from languages like Java, C, and others.

### [](#context) Context

When working with Java and Python, it is crucial to understand the fundamental differences in how these languages handle variable creation and memory management. While both languages provide mechanisms for referencing values in memory, their approaches differ significantly due to their underlying paradigms.

### [](#Variable-creation-in-Java) Variable creation in Java

How a variable is created in languages like Java? By declaring its type, naming it and then assigning a value to it. This is needed because Java is a statically typed language, meaning that variable types must be explicitly declared at compile time.

Like this:
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myVar = 10; // This line here is where we create a variable
        System.out.println(myVar); // prints 10
    }
}
```
What do happen behind the scenes is that when you do `int myVar = 10;`, Java creates a space in the stack memory to store the value of `myVar`, but only because `int` is a primitive data type, otherwise, it would be stored in the _heap memory_, and the variable would only has a reference where to find the data in the _heap memory_.

Within a Java variable you can find its data type and its data value, the variable has its information. Which you will see that isn't the same for Python "variables".

### [](#Variable-creation-in-Java) Variable creation in Python

To understand that you should know that Python doesn't use the term variable, instead it uses the term _**name**_ that would be conventionally called a variable. So in Python we say a _**name**_ refers to a **_value_** or an _**object**_, but the _**name**_ doesn't contain the _**value/object**_, like a variable do. A good analogy is saying that your name refers to you but it don't contains you. There may even be multiple names for the same thing, just as you may have given a name and a nickname. A _**value**_ is a particular instance of data in memory.

What happen in Python is just different, in Python there is no variable storing the data type, that's why Python in contrast, is dynamically typed and follows a name-binding model rather than direct memory assignment. Variables in Python are merely names that reference objects in memory. You can assign a _name_ firstly with a `float` value and in the very next line, use the same _name_ to assign a `int` value and no error will happen. Like this:
```python
cloth_price = 19.99 ## Assigning a float
cloth_price = 10 ## Assigning a int
```
The code above demonstrates how assign a _value_ to a _name_ in Python. That way, the name `cloth_price` is bound to the value `10` which is in the memory, meaning that the name `cloth_price` can be used to refer the value `10` in memory. This operation of binding is referred as an _assignment_.

If we assign other name to the name `cloth_price`, let say `blouse = cloth_price` the value 10 won't get copied but the name `blouse` will refer to the same original value as `cloth_price` is bounded.

The image below can ilustrate it better:

What should happen if we modify the value referenced using the name `cloth_price`, will modify the value referenced by the name `blouse`? The answer is **NO**!

The reason is when a variable is assigned in Python, it does not store a value directly but instead acts as a label pointing to an object in memory, so if we do that:

```python
cloth_price = 10
blouse = cloth_price
print(cloth_price) ## prints 10
print(blouse) ## prints 10
cloth_price = cloth_price + 3
print(cloth_price) ## prints 13
print(blouse) ## prints 10
```
It can be ilustrated as below:

![](https://github.com/odravison/odravison.github.io/blob/main/not_included_assets/assigning_two_names_different_values.png?raw=true)

As you can see, in the second line, `cloth_price` and `blouse` both reference the same integer object 10. After the line `cloth_price = 13` is executed, in this case since integers are immutable in Python, any modification (`cloth_price = cloth_price + 3`) results in `cloth_price` refering to a new object.


### [](#The-Danger-In-Python) The Danger in Python

Until here we've discussed about how to assign a name to a value using Python and how it differs from Java and other languages. In this particular example we used a `int` object data type which is one of many immutable data types in Python, such as `bool`, `float`, `tuple`, `string`, and `Unicode`. Those types can't suffer mutation, therefore, every time you do some operation in one of its data, Python creates another _value_ in the memory as result of your operation over the original _value_.

But Python has mutable data types too, they are `set` , `list` , `dict` and Data classes. When you mutate a mutable datatype, Python don't create a new value for it, so any other name bounded with that value still get the modification. An example to ilustrate what I mean is following below:

```python
## Consider the function below that receives a list of integers
## and prinst the lowest number in that list
def find_lowest(prices):
    prices.sort()
    print(prices[0])


## Now let use the function to find the lowest price in a list of integers
cloth_prices = [10, 13, 2, 4, 5]
find_lowest(cloth_prices)
print(cloth_prices)
```

After run this code, we'll get the followind output:
```python
2
[2, 4, 5, 10, 13]
```

At first glance, you may assume that the function would make a copy of the `cloth_price` to the function argument `prices`, but when you pass an argument to a function you're bounding a value to a name, like any assignment operation, in that case it was like `prices = cloth_prices`, so the name `prices` is bounded to the value as `cloth_prices` is, so every mutation made in the value (the list) it will reflect in any name bounded to it.

To overcome this, you should make a copy of the value and then made the mutation you want.

```python
def find_lowest(prices):
    prices = sorted(prices)
    print(prices[0])
```

The builtin `sorted()` Python's function receives a list and returns a new list, avoiding changing the original values.



### [](#The-long-story,-short) The long story, short

To avoid to get you too exhausted, let wrap up what we have learned about names and values in Python, its difference with Java and why mutable values in Python should be treated carefully:

##### Key differences between Java and Python
1.  **Typing System**: Java enforces static typing, requiring explicit type declarations, whereas Python dynamically binds names to objects.

2.  **Memory Model**: Java distinguishes between primitive and reference types, whereas Python treats everything as an object.

3.  **Variable Behavior**: In Java, primitive values are stored directly, while objects are referenced. In Python, all variables act as references to objects in memory.

4.  **Mutability Impact**: Pythonâ€™s immutable types (e.g., integers, strings) cause variables to reference new objects upon modification, while Java maintains references until explicitly reassigned.

##### Dangers of Python's Name-Value Model:

1.  **Immutable Types**: For types like integers, strings, and tuples, any modification results in the creation of a new object, leaving previously bound names unchanged.

3.  **Mutable Types**: For types like lists, dictionaries, and sets, modifications affect all names referencing the same object, which can lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.


I hope you liked that content, this is the result of my continous reasearch and learning path to become a senior Python developer.
