title: Why I did this blog
published: true

Some time ago, I was thinking about start a blog of mine so I can write some cool stuff. Firstly I thought to write about technology - it would be a techblog - but then I realized that advancing in a carrer isn't just about technical skills - overtime, humans challenges become just as important, and in tech industry isn't different.

That's why I've decided to write about my daily working experiences as well, dilemmas that surround my carrer, job, teammates and technology.

Without futher ado, my name is Odravison Amaral (you can call me Odra), and I'm a experienced software engineer with Java and Python background. In this blog you will find valuable posts - whether technical insights to help you solve problems or reflections on the challenges of tech careers â€” that I hope will support your professional growth.
