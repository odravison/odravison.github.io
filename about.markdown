    Hello there,
    <section>
    I am a web software engineer mostly focused on distributed systems using microservices in the web. I consider myself as an enthusiastic person when it comes to technology. I like to learn and build things that solve daily problems in a collaborative way. Currently, Iâ€™m looking forward to consolidate my skills as a Senior Software Engineer so I can promote my career growth, while also being able to teach, support others, and continue learning.
